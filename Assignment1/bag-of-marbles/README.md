Fernando Salazar


Marbles are going to be represnted by var that has the color, size and some id that is assigned by the program

A function that will add new marbles, each marble added must have the color and size.

A function to remove a marble, Will be done by assigned ID, not sure if it will be random or somekind of marble in first out first rule.
Need to check if bag is empty before attemping remove marble


A function to list all the marbles with ID and amount in the bag.

Im not sure yet IF the marbles information will be stored in a list or someother method yet to test the functions for adding and removal. I will check marble count. and if all the fields are filled.

For the list function , I can compare what the list should be to what has been added.

All of this will be done using the cmd prompt for input.
